I ride my bike all the time and feel fortunate to live in a region with multiple conveniently-located trails without car traffic.
A lot of trails in Bay Area are well-maintained and great for a morning run, commute or leisure afternoon stroll.
Below, I include a few photos of my favourite trails in the region.

## Bay Trail

This is a long and very picturesque trail that meanders around south San Francisco bay. Shrubs and ponds around the trail are home to many small animals, such as rabbits, foxes and birds. Something to watch out for: the trail from Mountain View to Sunnyvale is not paved and doesn't work well for biking on a rainy day (sand would stick to a bike). Also, geese occasionally decide to "close" the trail for a family gathering.

Goats near Sunnyvale section of Bay Trail are eating a delicious meal to prevent wildfires and support native plant species growth.

## Steven's Creek Trail

As the name suggests, this trail runs along a creek. If you look at the water, you can frequently spot an egret or a family of ducks. Egrets nest along a segment of nearby Shorebird Way that closes for a few months every year to create a safe environment for these magestic birds. Steven's Creek Trail also receives most traffic among all trails on this list due to its convenient location near urban areas.

## Los Altos - Palo Alto bike path

This trail connects Barron Park region of Palo Alto to north of Los Altos. My favourite part has mature oak trees overhanging the trail and thereby creating a green tunnel.

## Permanente Creek Trail

Permanente Creek trails is a short but convenient trail for crossing highway 101 in Mountain View. Occasionally, neighborhood birds of prey stop by to enjoy breakfast in peace on top of trail's high barriers.
